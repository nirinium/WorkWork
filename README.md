# WorkWork

This is a bot I created for an outdated version of the game World of Warcraft (2.4.3).

This is my first real interaction with C#, which is the language in which the bot is written.

This project was created and is meant for educational purposes only and took about a week to reach its current state.
I am not responsible for any use of this software.

Memory pointers and offsets not included.

Features include: Farming, grinding, skinning, mining, gathering herbs, walking to corpse and resurrecting and more.
